Using the `tar` command allows users to merge multiple files into one archived file which the `gzip` command then compresses for storage optimization. When used in conjunction they produce files with a '.tar.gz' or '.tgz' extension.

## 5. rar:
Linux users employ the `rar` command to make RAR archives and comb and regulate such archive files. The tool enables file compression and adds password security features and generates error correction records. Users typically work with specific functions which involve creating '.rar' files as well as extracting their file contents.
